# üêö Shell Scripting Journey  

This repository documents my learning progress in **Shell Scripting**, covering everything from the basics to intermediate-level scripting techniques.  

---

## üìå Topics Covered  

### 1. Introduction to Shell and Environment Setup  
- Understanding what a Shell is (Bash, Zsh, etc.)  
- Role of Shell in Linux/Unix systems  
- Setting up the environment for shell scripting  
- Running scripts using `sh` / `bash`  
- Making scripts executable with `chmod +x script.sh`  
- Adding Shebang (`#!/bin/bash`)  

---

### 2. Basic Scripting Skills  
- Writing simple shell scripts  
- Variables (user-defined & environment variables)  
- Taking user input (`read` command)  
- Using comments (`#`)  
- Command substitution (`$(...)` or backticks)  
- Arithmetic operations (`expr`, `$(( ))`)  
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `elif`)  
- Case statements (`case ... esac`)  
- Loops:  
  - `for` loops  
  - `while` loops  
  - `until` loops  

---

### 3. Intermediate Scripting Techniques  
- Working with functions (defining & calling functions)  
- Command-line arguments (`$0`, `$1`, `$#`, `$@`)  
- Exit status (`$?`) and return codes  
- File test operators (`-f`, `-d`, `-r`, `-w`, `-x`)  
- String operations (length, comparison, concatenation)  
- Arrays in Bash (indexing, iteration)  
- Debugging scripts with `set -x` and `set -e`  
- Handling signals and traps (`trap` command)  

---

## üöÄ Next Steps  
- Advanced scripting concepts  
- Shell scripting projects (automation, system monitoring, DevOps tasks)  
- Real-world problem solving with scripts

## üí° How to Run  
```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x script.sh

# Run the script
./script.sh
